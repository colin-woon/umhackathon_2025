  glassnode:

    - path: "transactions/count"
      params: { a: "BTC", i: "24h" } # Example: Daily interval

      params: { exchange: "Binance", symbol: "BTCUSDT", interval: "1h" }
  candles: # Candle source uses a slightly different structure if needed, or can follow path/params
     # Option 1: Keep original topic string for candles if simpler? (Script needs adjustment)
     # - "bybit-linear|candle?symbol=BTCUSDT&interval=1h"
     # Option 2: Use path/params structure (Script needs adjustment to handle source correctly)
     - source_override: "bybit-linear" # Specify the source host part
       path: "candle"
       params: { symbol: "BTCUSDT", interval: "1h"}

features:
  - "price_return"            # How much the price changed
  - "volatility"              # How volatile the price was
